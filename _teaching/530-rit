This course will cover the basic theory and techniques of Digital Integrated Circuit Design in CMOS technology. Topics include CMOS transistor theory and operation, design and implementation of CMOS circuits, fabrication process, layout and physical design, delay and power models, static and dynamic logic families, testing and verification, memory and nanoscale technologies. Laboratory assignments and project facilitate in hands-on learning of circuit-level design and simulation, layout and parasitic extractions, pre and post-layout verification and validation, full- custom flow and Synthesis based flow, using industry standard CAD tools.
