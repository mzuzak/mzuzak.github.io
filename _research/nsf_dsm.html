Due to the rising cost of semiconductor manufacturing, computer chip designers are increasingly reliant on offshore manufacturers. These manufacturers are generally considered to be untrusted, driving concerns of intellectual property (IP) piracy and theft. Logic obfuscation, also called logic locking, was developed to mitigate these threats, however, its effectiveness varies widely based on how obfuscation resources are allocated throughout a system. This project studies how to model, automate, and evaluate the high-level configuration of logic obfuscation in a system to maximize security with minimal design overhead. The project's novelties are the system-wide view of the obfuscation resource allocation problem and the framework to generate mathematical models for this allocation problem. The purpose of these models is to automatically identify effective distributions of budgeted obfuscation resources in varied computer chips and provide intuition on how obfuscation secures a complex system. The project's broader significance and importance are in lowering the barrier to developing secure computer chips for high-trust applications (e.g., healthcare, defense, finance, and automotive) through automation. The integration of education and research is a key objective. This includes research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as well as open-source course modules to train next-generation security experts for the workforce.<br/> <br/>This project bridges the knowledge gap between combinational, gate-level logic obfuscation schemes and their security impact in the larger integrated circuit they protect. Specifically, the project develops a design space modeling framework for logic obfuscation system configuration in order to budget obfuscation resources, allocate resources to design regions, and specify obfuscation schemes in these regions. Given a fixed budget of various obfuscation resources, these models automatically identify obfuscation configurations that fulfill system-wide security goals with minimal design overhead. The research artifacts are 1) quantifiable system security metrics for obfuscation, 2) an open-source design space modeling framework for obfuscation, and 3) a verification of generated models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The need for high-end performance and cost savings has driven hardware design houses to outsource integrated circuit (IC) fabrication to untrusted manufacturing facilities. During fabrication, the entire chip design is exposed to these potentially malicious facilities, raising concerns of intellectual property (IP) piracy, reverse engineering, and malicious hardware modification. This is a major concern of both government and private organizations, especially in the context of military hardware. Logic obfuscation is a popular approach to mitigate these hardware security threats. Obfuscation techniques lock a circuit by inserting extra key logic into combinational blocks. The resulting design only exhibits its intended functionality when a correct key is applied after fabrication. Without a functional IC, malicious entities cannot obtain design secrets, alleviating security concerns. <p>

The majority of logic obfuscation research centers on evaluating gate-level constructions with module-level criteria. However, obfuscated modules do not operate in isolation, but rather as a small part of a complex system. To protect an IC from a malicious foundry, the IC as a whole must be secured. By considering only module-level criteria, prior research ignores key architectural context that greatly impacts the efficacy of obfuscation, such as the interaction between modules and application error resilience. Our research demonstrates that this architectural context severely limits hardware security guarantees. To show this, we derived a fundamental theoretical trade-off underlying all obfuscation techniques and expanded on this by developing an open-source obfuscation simulator, called ObfusGEM, and applying the derived theoretical trade-off to guide a design space exploration of obfuscation. This exploration showed that state-of-the-art obfuscation schemes, which do not consider architectural context, were unable to secure each evaluated IC. These findings drive our current research in this area: 1) Developing security-aware architecture design practices to improve security and 2) Developing novel obfuscation strategies with specific application-classes in mind.
